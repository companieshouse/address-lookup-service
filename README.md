# address-lookup-api
Provides address lookup and validation to be used by CHIPS and frontend CH services. Addresses to be validated using a live API provided by Ordinance Survey, with a cache in a Postgres database and a backup solution of data stored in the Postgres db.

## Building and Running Locally using Docker

1. Clone [Docker CHS Development](https://github.com/companieshouse/docker-chs-development) and follow the steps in the README.
2. Enable the service using the command `chs-dev services enable address-lookup-api`
3. Boot up the services' containers on docker using tilt `chs-dev up`.

## Building the docker image
```
mvn package -Dskip.unit.tests=true -Dskip.integration.tests=true jib:dockerBuild
```

## Running locally

The application uses Spring Boot Docker Compose support to start a local PostGIS
Postgres database from `compose.yaml`. The `local` profile uses
`db.changelog-local.yaml`, which creates and seeds the `add_gb_royalmailaddress`
table from `gb_royalmailaddress.csv`.

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

Look up addresses by postcode:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/address-lookup-api/addresses?postcode=WF2%207QD"
```

Look up addresses in the legacy response format:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/address-lookup-api/multiple-addresses?postcode=WF2%207QD"
```

The local database is exposed on port `5433` to avoid clashing with any existing
Postgres running on the default `5432` port.

Without the `local` profile, Liquibase uses `db.changelog-master.yaml`, which
creates the schema without loading seed data. Provide `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`,
`SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, and `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` when connecting to
an externally hosted database.
